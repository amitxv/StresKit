## Building

The ``build.py`` script can be used to build the ISO. It is designed to run on [ubuntu-latest](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#choosing-github-hosted-runners) for GitHub actions, but you can use whichever Linux distro.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amitxv/StresKit.git
cd StresKit/
python build.py
```
